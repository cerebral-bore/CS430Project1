Project 1 using ppms for Computer Graphics

"Code should be able to read or write P3 or P6 ppm files."
	Your program (ppmrw) should have this usage pattern to convert a P3 or P6 picture to P3	
		ppmrw 3 <input.pmm> <output.pmm> or ppmrw 6 <input.pmm> <output.pmm>
	Your program (ppmrw) should have this usage pattern to convert a P3 or P6 picture to P6

-In advance warning, I was unable to setup converting between p3 and p6 as well as reading of p3 files into memory.-

There is a hard-coded p3 image that will be created and a p6 image can be read and written from and into binary data.
